<img src="./static/favicon.png" alt="Gravatar Lookup Tool Logo" width="200"/>

### Available here: [gravatarlookup.vercel.app](https://gravatarlookup.vercel.app)

Looks up [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) profile pictures via an email, good for easily grabbing and downloading your own avatar if you don't have access to it anymore

This app uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), as well as the beautiful [Sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/) and was mainly made so I can get my hands dirty and build _something_ with Svelte. Deployment and Getting started instructions 
are below.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
